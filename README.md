# FSND Movie Trailer Website

This is the 1st project in the Udacity FSND program, using server side
python code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse my
favorite movies, read a short snippet and watch the associated trailers.

The required modules for running the project:

-entertainment_center.py

-fresh_tomatoes.py

-media.py

This project was created with Python 2.7.12, so Python 2.7.X should be used.
The following steps to run the project:

-download and unzip the provided .zip file containing the files

-using Python 2.7.X, open IDLE

-navigate to the newly unzipped folder, and open entertainment_center.py

-run entertainment_center.py, which will generate, store, then open the webpage

-click on any movie poster to play its associated youtube trailer
